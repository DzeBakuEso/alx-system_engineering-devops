Postmortem: Duty Roster Automation System Outage

Issue Summary

Duration: March 1, 2025, 2:00 AM GMT – March 1, 2025, 6:30 AM GMTImpact: The Duty Roster Automation System was completely unavailable during the outage. Duty scheduling officers could not generate or view assignments, leading to manual intervention. Approximately 85% of users were affected, including command officers unable to access rosters for duty shifts.Root Cause: A database connection failure due to an unexpected surge in concurrent requests, exhausting available connections and causing PostgreSQL to stop responding.

Timeline

1:50 AM GMT – Automated monitoring detected high CPU usage on the PostgreSQL database.

2:00 AM GMT – System alerts triggered, reporting failed API requests and slow responses.

2:15 AM GMT – Engineers began investigating the issue, initially suspecting a faulty deployment.

2:45 AM GMT – Database logs showed multiple connection timeouts and excessive open connections.

3:00 AM GMT – Attempts to restart the Flask application were unsuccessful.

3:30 AM GMT – Misleading assumption that the issue was due to a Flask memory leak led to unnecessary debugging.

4:00 AM GMT – Engineers escalated the issue to the infrastructure team for database analysis.

5:00 AM GMT – It was discovered that connection pooling was not optimized, leading to maxed-out connections.

5:30 AM GMT – Connection limits were increased, and a temporary restart of the database server restored functionality.

6:30 AM GMT – Full functionality restored, and users confirmed that the system was accessible again.

Root Cause and Resolution

The outage was caused by an unoptimized PostgreSQL connection pooling strategy. The default configuration had a low maximum connection limit, and a sudden surge in requests exceeded this limit, causing connection timeouts and system-wide failures.

Resolution:

Increased PostgreSQL connection limits.

Configured connection pooling using PgBouncer to manage and reuse database connections efficiently.

Restarted the database and application services to clear stalled connections.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements:

Optimize database connection pooling to handle higher loads.

Implement auto-scaling for database resources to accommodate traffic spikes.

Improve logging and monitoring for better detection of connection exhaustion.

Actionable Tasks:

Configure PgBouncer for efficient connection management.

Set up alerts for high connection usage in PostgreSQL.

Add retry mechanisms for database queries to avoid hard failures.

Perform load testing to simulate high-traffic scenarios.

Optimize API query efficiency to reduce unnecessary database load.

Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.

By implementing these measures, we aim to prevent future outages and improve system reliability.
