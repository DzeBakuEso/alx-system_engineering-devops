### Background Context
This project focuses on the fundamental Bash scripting concepts of loops, conditions, and parsing. 

---

### Resources
**Read or Watch**:
- Loops sample
- Variable assignment and arithmetic
- Comparison operators
- File test operators
- Portability in scripts

**Manual Pages**:
- `env`
- `cut`
- `for`
- `while`
- `until`
- `if`

### Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to:
1. Create SSH keys and understand their importance.
2. Explain the difference between `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `#!/bin/bash`.
3. Use `while`, `until`, and `for` loops in Bash scripts.
4. Implement conditional statements with `if`, `else`, `elif`, and `case`.
5. Use the `cut` command effectively.
6. Understand and apply file and comparison operators.

### Requirements
- **Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **OS**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **File Standards**:
  - All scripts should end with a new line.
  - All scripts must be executable.
  - The first line of all scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.
  - The second line should be a comment explaining the scriptâ€™s purpose.
- **Shellcheck**: Use version 0.7.0, with all scripts passing without errors.
- **Restrictions**:
  - Do not use `awk`.
  - Plagiarism is strictly forbidden.
