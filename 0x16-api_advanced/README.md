# 0x16. API Advanced

## Description
This project focuses on working with APIs, specifically the Reddit API, to practice making API calls, handling pagination, parsing JSON results, and using recursive functions. The goal is to become comfortable with API interactions, which are common in technical interviews and real-world applications.

## Background Context
APIs are a crucial part of modern software development, and understanding how to interact with them is a valuable skill. This project provides hands-on experience with the Reddit API, which offers numerous endpoints that do not require authentication. By completing this project, you will gain confidence in making API calls, processing data, and presenting it effectively.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Read API documentation to identify the necessary endpoints.
- Use an API with pagination to retrieve large datasets.
- Parse JSON results returned by an API.
- Make recursive API calls to handle nested or paginated data.
- Sort a dictionary by its values.

## Resources
- [Reddit API Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
- [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should follow the PEP 8 style guide
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All modules must have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- You must use the `Requests` module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API
