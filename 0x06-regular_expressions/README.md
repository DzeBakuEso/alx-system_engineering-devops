## Concepts
For this project, we expect you to explore the concept of **Regular Expressions**.

### Background Context
You will be tasked with building your regular expressions using Oniguruma, a regex library. Note that other regex libraries may have different properties.

### Ruby Code Example
You will use the following Ruby code as a template for your regex implementations. Replace the regex part (the code between the `//`):

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
puts ARGV[0].scan(/127.0.0.[0-9]/).join
