## Background Context
In this project, you will be graded on two main aspects:
1. **Web-01 Server Configuration**: Ensuring that your server meets the specified requirements.
2. **Bash Automation Scripts**: Writing Bash scripts that automate server configuration tasks without manual intervention.

This project emphasizes automation. Automating repetitive tasks is crucial for efficiency, especially when managing hundreds or thousands of servers. The checker will execute your scripts as the `root` user, so you don't need to include the `sudo` command in your scripts.

### Example Task
To create a file `/tmp/test` containing `hello world` and update Nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of 80, your script might look like this:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Configuring a server with specification XYZ
echo hello world > /tmp/test
sed -i 's/80/8080/g' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
